RetatrutideTrial,sammi_1723,Muscle Mass,atlhart,"Testing sites do not test it and yes I’ve lost significant mass.

I 100% could have done better. During the ramp up phase my appetite was so suppressed, and I got so full so quickly, I could not eat 100g, much less 150g, of protein. Trying to get your protein in was a double edged sword. I needed a lot of protein to maintain muscle mass, but the more protein I ate the faster I felt full and longer I felt full. So the closer I’d get to 75-100g the harder it was to eat another gram of protein. 

Additionally, I slacked off in the gym once I started seeing such non-gym results. I’ve lost 55 lbs dropping from 230 to 175. All of my lifts suffered, but my bench press disproportionately was effect. I was pushing 5x5 @205 lbs and now I’m at 5x5@135 lbs. The rest of my lifts saw about a 25% decrease.

I should have done better. But I think some muscle mass is unavoidable at the rate people are dropping."
RetatrutideTrial,sammi_1723,Muscle Mass,Yuyogran,"My study site does an InBody scan at each visit and gives me a copy of the results. I am 61F. At my 3-month visit I was down 22 lbs of fat but I had gained 2 lbs of “lean body mass”. (12% weight loss). Protein 120g/day, resistance training 2-3x/wk."
RetatrutideTrial,sammi_1723,Muscle Mass,Due-Sun4191,"My testing site doesn’t track muscle mass, but I know I’ve lost a lot.  I’m trying to eat at least 100 g of protein a day but don’t always hit that goal.  I also haven’t been working out because I’ve been tried and weak. Starting to have more energy so hopefully I can exercise and gain back some lost muscle."
RetatrutideTrial,sammi_1723,Muscle Mass,sammi_1723,"Wow, thank you for sharing! I thought the glucagon component would have some sort of muscle preserving action but your experience sounds pretty similar to Tirzepatide. I guess we shall see."
RetatrutideTrial,sammi_1723,Muscle Mass,sammi_1723,Congrats! Good to hear.
RetatrutideTrial,sammi_1723,Muscle Mass,swellfog,You are my hero!!
RetatrutideTrial,sammi_1723,Muscle Mass,sammi_1723,It seems strength training is key no matter what way you lose weight. I’m also trying on Tirzepatide but the fatigue is tough. Good luck!
RetatrutideTrial,sammi_1723,Muscle Mass,RunningFNP,Yeah I lost some upper body strength as well. But part of it was I was just losing weight so fast despite trying to eat as much protein as possible. I lost almost 70 lb in 6 months. Some muscle loss at that weight loss rate is inevitable
RetatrutideTrial,sammi_1723,Muscle Mass,Yuyogran,Still have a long way to go.
RetatrutideTrial,sammi_1723,Muscle Mass,swellfog,Yeah but keeping up the weight training and actually gaining muscle. That’s fantastic!
RetatrutideTrial,sammi_1723,Muscle Mass,Yuyogran,"I understand that it’s because I am new to the weight training (lifelong cardio person), so apparently you make big gains at first but then you get diminishing returns as you go on."
RetatrutideTrial,sammi_1723,Muscle Mass,swellfog,Aha! Good to know. Thanks!
RetatrutideTrial,lace2020,Applied for my first trial,peachpotatototo,"I called the site directly and got pre-screened over the phone. I googled my local site and found their phone number that way.

It took me about 3 weeks to get in after did that for my trial.

Question: do they all require a 3 month wash out from WL drugs?

I am in a Lilly Mounjaro study now, but it is finishing soon and I would like to try for a Retatrutide study.

I still have quite a few lbs to loose, and while Mounjaro my WL has be about 0.5-1 lb a week. I’m nearly at a year, and bizarrely, my WL seems to be getting a little faster! 

Love to hear your thoughts and thanks again for all of the info!!"
RetatrutideTrial,RunningFNP,MORE Retatrutide trials are enrolling! ,Ok-Seaworthiness-542,"I appreciate this information SO MUCH! Thank you. You mentioned in another post being involved in a Reta study. I am on Tirz but would love to try Reta. 

The closest study is like 5.5 hours away and may include 24 visits. I am just trying to get a sense of like really 24 visits, or maybe closer to 12? Crazy question maybe but I think I could swing it 12. Thoughts, ideas?"
RetatrutideTrial,RunningFNP,MORE Retatrutide trials are enrolling! ,RunningFNP,"Yes, you have to do the 3-month washout and you can't be in any other clinical trials. And of course you'd have to meet the criteria and get accepted into another trial! And of course there's the risk you'd get placebo as well! But you're welcome and good luck seeing if you can get into one!"
RetatrutideTrial,RunningFNP,MORE Retatrutide trials are enrolling! ,RunningFNP,Thing is you *have* to make all visits. They do pay for a some amount of travel/driving expenses. But I've heard of some folks doing just that and making it work
RetatrutideTrial,RunningFNP,MORE Retatrutide trials are enrolling! ,swellfog,"Thanks so much! Appreciate it! I couldn’t figure out the placebo ratio. 

I suspect they will be recruiting through the end of the year if they are looking for 10,000."
RetatrutideTrial,RunningFNP,MORE Retatrutide trials are enrolling! ,Ok-Seaworthiness-542,"Sorry, I didn't mean to imply I wouldn't go to all visits, I absolutely would which is why I am trying to get more info. In most of the descriptions they say _may_ require xx number of visits which makes it sound like there is some variability so I was wondering how much variability there might be."
RetatrutideTrial,RunningFNP,MORE Retatrutide trials are enrolling! ,RunningFNP,Triumph OUTCOMES will probably be a 1:1 placebo to drug mix. Big big trials like that usually are. And they'll probably pick one or two doses to assess. Probably will take a year to enroll that many patients
RetatrutideTrial,RunningFNP,MORE Retatrutide trials are enrolling! ,RunningFNP,Yeah broadly speaking for my trial anyways they've given me a schedule of visits and they're sticking to it. They have extenuating circumstances exceptions though. Might be worth checking out and asking. Biggest thing is they have scheduled lab visits and weight check visits which you have to make. Worst thing you can do is inquire and see how they can fit you in

RetatrutideTrial,Nenabobena,Week 24 update,notyouroldlady,"I’m on Triumph 4. I think I also went up to 12mg. I was miserable, serious food aversion and vomiting day after day. I’m currently having a week off, then I’ll go back on a reduced dosage. I only have 5kg until my goal weight, so I want to get those last few off slowly."
RetatrutideTrial,Nenabobena,Week 24 update,Mean-Homework1425,I’m sorry to hear that! I’m on 6mg and already wondering how on earth I will be able to eat anything on a higher dose!
RetatrutideTrial,Nenabobena,Week 24 update,UKIRAB1,See how you can do. Use zofran and compazine. Do protein shakes
RetatrutideTrial,Nenabobena,Week 24 update,Yuyogran,"I am also in Triumph 4 but I think I stayed on the 4 mg track. Down 25.7 lbs in 14 weeks and losing steadily, but have had no side effects at all; only experiencing the appetite suppression and reduction in cravings. The last two months have been about the same, so I don’t think the dosage increased. As I read about the struggles that people are having with the higher doses, I think I am okay with staying where I am, and it’s really helping me dial in the food and exercise because I can eat a full meal but then I am satisfied and don’t need to graze or snack. I guess this is the point of this trial after all - to see how people respond to different maintenance doses."
RetatrutideTrial,Nenabobena,Week 24 update,RunningFNP,Sorry you're having such a rough time still. I'm glad the trial site is working with you though. I eventually got used to 12mg and now have been much better with only occasional side effects and I can eat decent sized meals now. I hope the same can happen for you!
RetatrutideTrial,Nenabobena,Week 24 update,Jumpy-Actuator-9637,"I’m in a very similar boat.  I’m Triumph 1 and just got the final escalation.  I’m currently taking either 9 or 12.  I can barely eat.  I’m trying, but 2 or 3 bites and I’m full.  
I’ve already lost 30 lbs.  the clinic puts my BMI at 22, but my calculations put me at 25.  Next visit, I’ll probably be downgraded, but they only reduce to 9."
RetatrutideTrial,Nenabobena,Week 24 update,Aussie_Mopar,"I love it whilst at the clinic their Dr & dietitian harp on about you need to eat more food, pump more protein, your losing too much weight etc etc & my come back is always the same, “your drugs work, they work too good. You’re giving me drugs to lose weight, suppress hunger and it’s working.  I CANT EAT ANYMORE”

Weight loss so far,  11kg - 8weeks
Just started on 6mg
🇦🇺"
RetatrutideTrial,Nenabobena,Week 24 update,Nenabobena,"I’m on zofran, it works for my nausea but I still can’t eat much."
RetatrutideTrial,Nenabobena,Week 24 update,Jeepestgurl,"I also believe I am on the 4mg side of the trial, not a bad place to be as we just have to stay diligent. I start box 3 in a few days but my lot numbers match box 2 so this is why I believe that. I have lost 8lbs so far after 7 weeks."
RetatrutideTrial,Nenabobena,Week 24 update,Aussie_Mopar,"I wouldn’t believe you would have been kept at this lower dose for this long into the trial.

In Oz 🇦🇺, Each four week block it goes up, 2mg, 4mg, 6mg, 9mg (option 1stays on this) or option 2 goes up to 12mg

If at any stage, if have side effects, they can keep you at the current dose or if the effects are unmanageable they can move you down only one level. But they only keep you at the same level for two blocks of 4weeks.

By what you have described, your body might have just got use to the medication or maxing out. Remember, the means average % total body loss on 12mg at 24weeks is 17%. At 48week the total body loss average is roughly 23%. This is the average, some are higher & some are just lower. You could just be on the lower side.

RetatrutideTrial,Nenabobena,Week 24 update,RunningFNP,"I'm sorry you're having some of those side effects as well, but you bring up a point I'm very curious about, I'm wondering how many folks are getting dose reduced. Cuz it certainly seems like more than a few people have posted about that. I know I'm real close. My BMI is 24 And I'm finally maintaining and not losing"
RetatrutideTrial,Nenabobena,Week 24 update,Jeepestgurl,"My dietician appointments are not helpful. I have been watching my food for years. My duet was never messy so she has little to improve on. I find her recommending Kodiak cakes and stuff I simply would not eat over my favorite carrots and hummus. So, I take it with a grain of salt. I up my protein,  that is my biggest change.🤷‍♀️"
RetatrutideTrial,Nenabobena,Week 24 update,Yuyogran,"True. I believe that needing to stay diligent will prove better over the long tern because hopefully we will have had time to create better eating habits. It must be a lot more difficult to stick to your eating plans if you are food averse and just trying to get your calories and protein in. However, I am happy to read that some people on the higher doses do get adapted to them."
RetatrutideTrial,Nenabobena,Week 24 update,Yuyogran,"The way it was explained to me, the Phase 3 study has 4 arms. One is the placebo, then the other 3 groups start at 2 mg then go to 4 mg. One group stays at 4 mg while the other two go on to 6 mg and then 9 mg. One group stays at 9 mg and the last group goes on to 12 mg. I did notice changes with the first two boxes but not since, so I am sure I stayed at 4 mg."
RetatrutideTrial,Nenabobena,Week 24 update,Jeepestgurl,I'm just happy we got something 🤣 my biggest fear was placebo
RetatrutideTrial,Nenabobena,Week 24 update,Yuyogran,I am sure you are right. Maybe they change it up for the different countries? Our trial goes for 77 weeks. 🇨🇦
RetatrutideTrial,Nenabobena,Week 24 update,Aussie_Mopar,"In Oz 🇦🇺 on study 4, which goes for 14months. 
Their schedule follows what I set out above with doses"
RetatrutideTrial,Nenabobena,Week 24 update,Yuyogran,"Oh so true. There  was no question for me - I had an instantaneous lack of desire for sweets, fast food, and wine. That alone was enough to start moving the needle. 🙂"
RetatrutideTrial,Nenabobena,Week 24 update,Aussie_Mopar,"That was my biggest fear too, the good old Placebo. Something no one wanted 🤣"
RetatrutideTrial,Nenabobena,Week 24 update,Jeepestgurl,14 months. We were told 80 weeks so 20 months. I wonder how it can be longer in one country and not another 🤔 perhaps rules in different countries dictate that though
clinicalresearch,Dizzy_Security684,Lawsuit? Do CRCs need personal malpractice insurance? Thoughts?,here4wandavision,"No… I’d be interested in the context in which this came up. But you should be performing under your scope of practice (i.e. what you were hired to do) and doing delegated activities that are within that scope. 

For example, a clinical research coordinator that does not have a current registered nurse licensure in the state that they are currently employed and/or working, should not be doing any clinical evaluations that only a nurse is licensed and scoped to do in the state that you were working. A clinical research coordinator could presumably take vital signs with a blood pressure cuff that isn’t manual and a pulse oximeter or it is within their scope to take that information from the chart.

 At the site I previously worked at our hospital made all of the clinical research coordinators become a certified phlebotomist in order to ensure that we were acting within our scope of practice when doing study blood draws because whole we could be delegated on the delegation of authority log to do a blood draw for the study, we may not have had the experience or licensure to do so. Legal found this out one day and had a stroke which lead to us all getting certified 

But I cannot imagine an instance where a clinical research coordinator or professional, including a research nurse would need to have additional malpractice insurance or any type of insurance above and beyond with their place of employment, covered as conditions of employment"
clinicalresearch,Dizzy_Security684,Lawsuit? Do CRCs need personal malpractice insurance? Thoughts?,MooseAndMallard,"Your institution carries insurance which covers you, as long as you are not acting in a grossly negligent manner. If your institution is participating in industry-sponsored research, this would be spelled out in the clinical study agreement."
clinicalresearch,Dizzy_Security684,Lawsuit? Do CRCs need personal malpractice insurance? Thoughts?,Myrtle_Snow_,"If you aren’t licensed or certified in any medical or healthcare field and you’re put in a position to commit medical malpractice, that’s on your employer, not you. Your employer should also carry insurance that covers any employee who is interacting with patients."
clinicalresearch,Dizzy_Security684,Lawsuit? Do CRCs need personal malpractice insurance? Thoughts?,NotyouraverageAA,"The PI ultimately is responsible for study, coordinators are just delegated to perform certain tasks. If something were to happen involving medical malpractice I'm sure it would affect the organization or the PI first. Not to say CRCs are free of liability. They could be fired for messing up on the job."
clinicalresearch,Dizzy_Security684,Lawsuit? Do CRCs need personal malpractice insurance? Thoughts?,Dizzy_Security684,"Yeah, we were in a safety meeting that we go to every month. They were reviewing safety cases system-wide, discussing solutions, etc. Nurse brought up having own insurance because “they can come after everyone for that.” And, I just naturally asked the question about CRCs. Unsure. But, no, like I said just a thought. Our site runs at a high standard, never had any issues that would even come close to rising to this level.

Also, not being a nurse, I do not do clinical evaluations, blood draws, or any of the sort. I always accompany investigator into visits, phlebotomy does blood draws, MAs do vitals etc. I do review charts for prescreening, record lab values, etc but obviously PI ultimately reviews/signs off on labs, eligibility, etc.

Thank you for your thorough explanation! Coming from academic research and not a heavy healthcare background, it was just something I’ve never thought about."
clinicalresearch,Dizzy_Security684,Lawsuit? Do CRCs need personal malpractice insurance? Thoughts?,here4wandavision,I’m surprised the nurse felt they needed additional insurance. I would be interested in what made them feel that way. Technically you can sue anyone for anything but that just seems excessive
clinicalresearch,Dizzy_Security684,Lawsuit? Do CRCs need personal malpractice insurance? Thoughts?,bearfootmedic,"You get some odd nurses in research- I know some folks that have carried it, but they aren't the nurses I find to be the most reliable. Honestly, I think it's a grift from the insurance world. Insurance companies don't exist for the benefit of the subscribers - and if the insurance is inexpensive, it suggests a relatively low risk event. 

At least at the academic site I work at, they will go to court for you. Though there's a tremendous amount of protection for state employees, so ymmv.

I will say that in research, as long as it's done properly, bad outcomes are an expected possibility. Very few people join an interventional research study because they have safe and effective options - and if there were competing options, it would have to be a relatively benign treatment with low risk of AE."
clinicalresearch,Dizzy_Security684,Lawsuit? Do CRCs need personal malpractice insurance? Thoughts?,Dizzy_Security684,Who knows? Might of just been blowing smoke. I do from time to time get lightly hazed as a non-nurse. Might of just been trying to give me even more anxiety.
clinicalresearch,Dizzy_Security684,Lawsuit? Do CRCs need personal malpractice insurance? Thoughts?,here4wandavision,You really do get some odd RNs in research.
clinicalresearch,Narrow_Inspection761,How does one become a clinical research coordinator? Please help 🥹,sassybitchinmolassy,I’d recommend looking into junior specialist or assistant CRC roles.

it takes a few years to become truly proficient in the role and youll leave by then…please dont pursue a role as a CRC, youll make everyones life challenging lol

sorry for the bluntness, but ive had my fill of site staff who dont know what theyre doing, who then leave a mess behind for me and my team to clean-up

youre better off finding a role in an academic lab, and not formal industry clinical research"
clinicalresearch,Narrow_Inspection761,How does one become a clinical research coordinator? Please help 🥹,Acceptable-Owl-8856,"Look at research assistant, study coordinator, or clinical research coordinator openings at academic sites. While I agree with other commenters that people usually don't *want* an applicant who intends to be gone in a year or two...academic sites are more entry level and get far fewer applicants than industry. It's not uncommon for the majority of your applicants to openly be pursuing some form or graduate school, and sometimes the few who aren't are objectively terrible fits for other reasons, so you take what you can get even if you know you'll be stuck hiring for that role again sooner than you'd like."

clinicalresearch,Narrow_Inspection761,How does one become a clinical research coordinator? Please help 🥹,cow2sea,"My site had several RAs who are headed to med school- I think you might have better luck in that role. Sites are unlikely to want to invest in someone who is guaranteed to leave within 2 years. If you are able to take on a CRC role, you're going to spend most of your gap learning how to do the job, and the last bit of your gap training a replacement. Agree that academic research might be more compatible with what you're looking for, but if you have previous lab experience and a genuine interest in research, look at *entry-level* industry positions as well."
clinicalresearch,Narrow_Inspection761,How does one become a clinical research coordinator? Please help 🥹,Familiar_Hunter_638,"dont get me wrong…objectively, it is a great opportunity to pad your resume for med and I would probably try to do the same if i was still premed

but it is a challenging role to get into currently and it takes time to actually get good at it.

theres probably some degree of nepotism/connections if people are getting into a CRC role right after undergrad lol"
clinicalresearch,Narrow_Inspection761,How does one become a clinical research coordinator? Please help 🥹,Myrtle_Snow_,At my site the jobs you’d qualify for are called “research assistant” or “research intern” but they’re similar to what other places call an assistant CRC. You get tons of direct patient contact and experience with many aspects of clinical research but you would have a more senior research coordinator overseeing your work and helping you manage the aspects of the study that you need help with.

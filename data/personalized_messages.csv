Also, not being a nurse, I do not do clinical evaluations, blood draws, or any of the sort. I always accompany investigator into visits, phlebotomy does blood draws, MAs do vitals etc. I do review charts for prescreening, record lab values, etc but obviously PI ultimately reviews/signs off on labs, eligibility, etc.
